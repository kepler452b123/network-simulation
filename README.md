# Network Simulation using OOP in C++ 

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to document and apply what I learn about computer networks and refresh OOP principles. There is not much practical use for this compared to tools such as Cisco Packet Tracer,
however I expect to make improvements on existing simulations later on. But for now, this is probably useless for anyone besides me. The emphasis on OOP will require documenting the class structures as I go.

## Tools
I expect to make abstractions of all the protocols and devices, so no outside tools will be used. For example, when implementing DNS I will create a fake list of domains -> IP addresses and use those as links
rather than using real domains/IP addresses and a DNS library to interface with the WAN. This might change later on, as I learn about suitable tools which I can interface with my program. Since this is a 
learning project however, I want to avoid abstracting away how these protocols work through libraries. I might, however, implement some kind of GUI using external C++ libraries.

I am using C++ because I am already good in Java. So it's to avoid boredom and gain a proficiency in using OOP in C++. Though I learned a little C++ through courses, it was fairly disconnected from actually 
constructing programs with C++ so I expect to learn a lot about the language as well. I am sane so I will not be using OOP with Python. 

## Class Structures
